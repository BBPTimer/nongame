          Welcome to The Nongame, a communication game! Players "compete" to
          complete laps around the board by answering prompts. The Nongame is
          great for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Therapy groups</li>
          <li>School classes</li>
          <li>Retirement home activities</li>
          <li>Family game night</li>
          <li>Youth groups</li>
          <li>
            Any gathering where people want to get to know each other better!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The game begins with the Setup form. First, choose which prompts you
          would like to appear in the game. Select a prompt deck category (All
          Ages, Families, Kids, Teens or Seniors) and depth (Lighthearted or
          Deep). Lighthearted questions make great icebreakers, while deep
          questions promote serious discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, select your number of players, and type in their names! The game
          supports 2-6 players. If you have more than 6 players, we recommend
          choosing 1 player and competing as a group to complete laps around the
          board. Click the Play! button to begin the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Player order is selected randomly. The first player will begin the
          game by clicking the dice. That player's emoji pawn moves to the
          appropriate space, and a prompt appears in the center of the board.
          Prompts fall into 3 categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Draw from the Deck!</i>: A random prompt is displayed from the
            previously-selected prompt deck.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <i>Question or Comment</i>: Ask someone a question OR comment on any
            subject. This gives players an opportunity to engage with each other
            and discuss any subject!
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <i>Talk About a Time...</i>: Players will talk about a time when
            they felt a certain emotion.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Other players should remain quiet when a player responds to a prompt!
          After a player responds, the next player rolls the dice, and play
          continues.
        </p>
        <p>
          As players make their way around the board, each player's lap counter
          will increase. 45 minutes to 1 hour makes for a great game length. See
          which player completes the most laps by the end of the game, and have
          fun!
